# Robotics-Arm-Manipulator

Goal: Simulated a 7-DOF Robotic Arm (kuka lwr arm) and also to plan the trajectories using ROS for a collision free movement

Topics: Kinematics, Dynamics and Control

Software- ROS, Python

Implementation
  * Simulated a 7-DOF Robotic Arm (kuka lwr arm) and also to plan the trajectories using ROS for a collision free movement
  * Controlled the position of the end effector in cartesian space using cartesian control and null space control
  * Improved by Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm to maneuver the end-effector to the desired pose collision free
